Why is ZTM different?
To be honest, there are plenty of fantastic resources including free ones… in fact Andrei outlines his entire journey of how he taught himself how to code and get hired for free in less than 6 months here and you could too.

However, it can get overwhelming and hard to find high quality resources and not get stuck in the trap of endless online tutorials (which are commonly outdated) with no clear next steps. We know, because we were in your shoes. We’re (Andrei, Yihua and Daniel) all self-taught developers and now have years of experience so we know exactly what works, what doesn’t and what companies look for. Our courses are guaranteed to be the most up to date and absolutely everything you need from zero experience to getting hired. They are exactly what we would have wanted when we were in your shoes.

We make learning fun and explain complex concepts using simple, easy-to-understand language and provide you with a vibrant, supportive private Discord community of 100,000+ other developers from around the world.

What kind of skills or special equipment do I need to join the ZTM Academy?
If you have a computer, access to the internet and the self motivation to learn, you’re all set. We teach you everything from the absolute basics to advanced topics and everything in between. We’re also continually releasing new courses and other exclusive content and resources.

What ZTM is NOT?
Your time and money is valuable. We are successful if you succeed and trust us throughout your career. Simple as that. We don’t need to charge an arm and a leg for us to do that for you. We’re not a $10,000+ bootcamp that forgets about you after 8 weeks. We’re not an $80,000+ 4 year university degree that doesn’t actually teach you the relevant in-demand skills you need to get hired. We’re not an income sharing program that is going to cost you way more than you expected.
